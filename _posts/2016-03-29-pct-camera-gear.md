Downside of being a hobby photographer: 22% of my entire gear weight is my
camera and half of my entire gear weight will be worn. Auch! Because of this
I've spent a lot of money on lower the weight of all my other gear though. The
camera is now the only luxury item I carry and I feel that justifies it's
weight.

My entire gear weight will be approximately 7.63kg (17 lbs) with the worn
camera weighing in at 1.34 kg (3 lbs). All the extras brought along only for
the camera is an additional 360g (12.5 oz) and the base weight excluding the
camera is at an impressive 3.8 kg (8.3 lbs). I'm pretty happy with the end
result to be honest.

### Camera: Sony A7R II + 16-35mm f/4

As I recently had all my camera gear stolen I also had the unique opportunity
to upgrade everything. I thought about downgrading and only carrying a pocket
camera like most people do, but then I remembered what it was like to have a
crappy camera to blame for my bad photosâ€“I much rather be blaming myself.

I expect having a full frame camera for the first time will be a big change.
Night photography with high ISOs here I come!

### Tripod: Trail-Pix + Trekking poles

There's nothing better than multipurpose gear! At first I wasn't planning on
carrying trekking poles at all but when I found this tripod ["adapter"][trailpix] it
suddenly became much more appealing. Only downside is I won't be able to take
milkyway photos with my tent in the foreground as the poles will be used for
pitching my tent as well. I'm assuming I at some point will be camping together
with other hikers who could borrow me their trekking poles though.

### Shoulder carrying clip: Capture Pro

This one is a bit of an experiment. The [Capture][capture] clip sounds like an
awesomly useful gadget, but the added weight on my shoulders is a concern.
Worst scenario is I ship the clip back home at some point. I also bought a
capture compatible release plate for the Trail-Pix tripod adapter which makes
the combination even more appealing.

### Filters: ND 9-stops & polarizer.

For those who don't know, ND filters are darkened glass you place in front of
your lens to dramatically decrease the amount of light captured. This can be
used to slow down the shutter speed and take those silky-smooth water photos
you've seen. I thought this might be something fun to play around with and it
only adds about 50g (1.8oz) to my base weight. In addition to the ND filter I
will also be carrying a polarizing filter to remove the reflection from water.
Usually these filters are also used for darkening the sky but due to my
ultra wide-angle lens I dont think I can use it for that purpose. If the angle
from the light source is too wide it will cause uneven shades across the sky.

### Camera charger: Heli-On Solar charger

Another experiment I'm hopeful for as long as it arrives in time for my start
date in June. Just like Capture and Trail-Pix, [Heli-On][helion] is another product
originating from Kickstarter. I'm really starting to enjoy all the niche
products you can find there. If it doesn't work out I might go for [Solar
paper][solar-paper] instead. Relying only on a power bank is not something I want
to do as that would force me to regularly stay in towns as I recharge my gear.
A solar charger gives much more freedom in my opinion and now I doubt I need
to carry more than one spare battery as the charger has a built in 2600 mAh
power-bank that's able to recharge my battery 2.5 times.

### Android Apps: None

After some research I couldn't really find any necessary apps to help me out.
There were some exposure calculators but the math is easy enough to do in your
head without wasting battery life. I do have [Sky Map][skymap] installed since
before and it could be useful for locating the milkyway but from experience
I've always been able to see it with my eyes only. I just need to keep track of
new moons.
