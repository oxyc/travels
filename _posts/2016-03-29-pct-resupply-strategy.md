On this blog I favour other more structured alternatives, but for making easily
editable plans, Google Maps is great. I thought I'd share a few of the
resources I put together for planning my resupply strategy.

### PCT waypoints in gpx, kml and geojson.

First of all I wanted a low quality line of the entire trail. I couldn't
actually find this anywhere, I only found waypoint collection and way too
detailed for the purpose of a simple overview. Finally after some searching
and conversion efforts I managed to get an importable trail line in the KML
format.

- [pct-trail.kml][pct-trail-kml] (for Google Maps)
- [pct-trail.gpx][pct-trail-gpx]
- [pct-trail.geojson][pct-trail-geojson]

Next up I needed a list of resuppply points on the trail, and found [this
map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=zS3eksAbf9dk.kFtYzRMZO_b8&hl=en)
already shared by someone else. I just copied it, exported it and re-imported
it into my own map. The waypoint set also contain some basic information
about mail drop addresses, opening hours etc but I wouldn't trust it's current.

- [pct-waypoints.kmz][pct-waypoints-kmz] (for Google Maps)
- [pct-waypoints.gpx][pct-waypoints-gpx]
- [pct-waypoints.geojson][pct-waypoints-geojson]

Now I had everything I needed to get a good overview of my options. To get
a better idea of how long it takes between each resupply point and how far
away from the trail they are, I used [Craig's PCT Planner](https://www.pctplanner.com/)
and started looking for resupply points which were close to the trail. I'd
rather not pick a town which requires a long hitchhike unless I really have
to. For additional comparison I also looked up reviews of every stop to see
how feasible it would be to resupply there.

### A couple of good pages I found for reading about indvidual towns

- [Great reviews of most towns from 2003](http://cwillett.imathas.com/pct/resupply.html)
- [Halfway Anywhere: Hiker Survey of popular mail box resupplies](http://www.halfwayanywhere.com/trails/pacific-crest-trail/pacific-crest-trail-hiker-survey-2015/)
- [Plan Your Hike: Basic information on the towns](http://planyourhike.com/planning/resupplypoints.php)
- [Best of the Crest: Decent reviews on most of the towns](http://www.emeraldlake.com/pctguide/pctindex.html)

Basically my first step was to highlight the towns close or on the trail that
had affordable resupply options. After that I started looking at the most
popular mail box resupply stations on Halfway Anywhere and then comparing
how far they were from the next/previous option. The goal was to stay within
managable resupply distances while minimizing time off the trail.

## Mail drop locations

I ended up picking 5 places where I would ship food instead of buying. I much
prefer buying my supplies while on the trek because of the shipping hassle as
a non-resident as well as the freedom of an open time schedule.

#### Stehekin

- Resupply option: Impossible, a favorite on Halfway Anywhere.
- Distance from previous: 209 km (Ross Lake trail; 130 miles)
- Distance to next: 158km (Skykomish; 98 miles)

#### White Pass

- Resupply option: Impossible, a favorite on Halfway Anywhere.
- Distance from previous: 159 km (Snoqualmie Pass; 99 miles)
- Distance to next: 238 km (Cascade Locks; 148 miles)

#### Big Lake Youth Camp

- Resupply option: Impossible. Trying to avoid Sisters.
- Distance from previous: 249 km (Cascade Locks; 155 miles)
- Distance to next: 143 km (Shelter Cove Resort; 89 miles)

#### Callahan's

- Resupply option: Impossible. Trying to avoid Ashland but if I need to buy
  new shoes, which I might, I'll skip this box and ship it somewhere further
  south when I might enjoy a change of food.
- Distance from previous: 168 km (Crater Lake Mazama Village; 104 miles)
- Distance to next: 103 km (Seiad Valley; 64 miles)

#### Seiad Valley

- Resupply option: Expensive, a favorite on Halfway Anywhere.
- Distance from previous: 103 km (Callahan's; 64 miles)
- Distance to next: 250 km (Castella; 155 miles)

Finally I've incorporated all of this in a [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zM4srgOlkXEw.kwrTiONCt_xs&usp=sharing).
The resupply stations I've also imported into the BackCountry Navigator App
on my phone. For offline maps I found a great [downloadable
atlas](http://pct14.blogspot.com/2015/01/pct-offline-maps.html) which contains
only the necessary topographical tiles (637mb).
